        <h4>A creamy, cheesy, and comforting meal</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Lb uncooked Elbow Macaroni</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/8 Tsp ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups Milk</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Half and Half</li>
            <li>2 1/2 Cups shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and lightly grease an 8' square (or similar size) baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the macaroni</strong> to al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk and half and half, stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes until the mixture has thickened like the consistency of gravy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until melted</li>
            <li><strong>Combine:</strong>Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Â½ cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong>for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.</li>
