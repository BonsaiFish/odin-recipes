        <h4>a sweet and salty treat.</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Natural Peanut Butter</li>
            <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>Coarse Sea Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the peanut butter, sugar, vanilla and egg until well combined. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the mixture about 1 inch apart onto un-greased baking sheets. Flatten the mounds with the tines of a fork, making a crosshatch pattern on the cookies. Sprinkle coarse salt on top of the cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake until golden around the edges, about 10 minutes, switching the position of the sheets halfway through baking. Transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        </ol>
