# odin-recipes
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

Self Reflection: In this project we were asked to create a home webpage that connects out to three recipes webpages (these recipes need to connect back to the homepage).
Within these pages we needed to use the abilities we have gained over the course so far:creating directories and files, remaking boilerplates, linking pages, imbedding images, ordered and unordered lists, different headings, strong and em, and git.
